        Its been long since I have blogged about my GSoC progress. I had been performing changes and nits for my patches so that they could land soon. I’m summarizing about some of my patches. You can check my code by visiting the Bug links.

        Finally entity capability implementation for XMPP is complete and is ready for review cycles. We have added the video discovery capability.

        Entity Discovery helps you figure out the device supported at both the ends of the conversation even before the service has been called for action so that the user knows about the capability of the service.

        Proceeding further the next priority task was to first add a “call disconnect” support to the video call and then it was to remove the auto connecting calls and instead send the notification to the callee whether to Accept/Reject the call.

        Until last week there used to be a harcoded offer and we converted this offer to XML Stanza and then retrieve it back. Moving forward we added the WebRTC methods in the conversation.xml binding which would generate the SDP offer in the DOMWindow.

      <div class="article-entry">
        To send a message from one client to the other we need a signaling channel which provides a path for data transfer over the network. While working with WebRTC PeerConnection API for a web app no one worries about the channel since the SDP (Session Description Protocol) “offer” and “answer” is sent over a plaintext channel.
