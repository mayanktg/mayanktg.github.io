Arrival at Gateway to the Garhwal"></a>I. Arrival at Gateway to the Garhwal</h2><p>I often look back at my travels and try to recall the moments that have changed something in me, helped me overcome my deepest insecurities, accept the realities and made me stronger. Taking my ninth trip (the longest one) this the year I wanted it to be special so I decided it would be without friends, without family. I wanted to figure out who I am when no is looking. Do I need to change? The answer was yes indeed. I needed to re-evaluate my priorities and goals in life. </p>
<h3 id="Reaching-YHAI-Basecamp-at-Rishkesh-Uttarakhand"><a href="#Reaching-YHAI-Basecamp-at-Rishkesh-Uttarakhand" class="headerlink" title="Reaching YHAI Basecamp at Rishkesh, Uttarakhand"></a>Reaching YHAI Basecamp at Rishkesh, Uttarakhand</h3><p>On July 21st midnight I took a HRTC bus from New Delhi ISBT to Rishikesh, unaware that it will my comfortable most journey for the rest of the travel. The bus arrived at Hardiwar at about 4:30am but had to take the bypass route due to the Kavad Yatra. It was downpouring heavily and Ganga was flowing furiously but I was greeted by more than 50 student bikers who were probably riding  to Rishikesh.</p>

<p>It took another hour and a half for me to reach Rishikesh. The realisation with this holy city is that, <em>its a kind of India you want India to be a lot of time. A city filled with life, easy, good life.</em><a href="https://gracefarsonblog.com/2013/05/26/rishikesh-an-overview/" target="_blank" rel="external">[s]</a> Kevads smoking Chillum at 6 in the morning was the first thing I saw upon arriving. I arrived at basecamp at 6:30am and was soon served with hot delicious breakfast. Being a little introvert I was insecured about how I will mix with other people and I became extremely conscious on the first day, didn’t talk much and as a result I acted weirdly. The interaction session was fun, much friendly infact, and we chose our Dharmesh Ji as our group leader who seconded our decision for the rest of the trek. We were warned about the bad wather conditions and how the previous batch were delayed due to landslides. We were supposed to leave at 5am next day. It continued to rain all night.</p>

<p>To our surprise everyone was awake by 4am and we left on time with our packed lunch. As always I was amongst the backbenchers in the bus.</p>

Joshimath and a surprising little revelation</h2><p>Chanting Lord Shiva’s name our ten hour long journey to Joshimath started. We had to cover a distance of 250kms. Two hours of reckless ride and almost ten people in the bus were already suffering from motion sickness. Our journey halted at around 7am when a truck broke down blocking the way ahead. Moving out of the bus and taking a look outside it appeared as if the Dashrathanchal Parvat has casted a bitwitching spell on everyone.</p>
